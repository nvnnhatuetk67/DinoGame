# Introduction
**DinoGame** is built using the SDL2 library and C++ programming language.
It is an exciting game that challenges players to run and jump their way through five different maps: Spring, Desert, Darknight, Green Valley, and Winter. The game's main character must use their skills to overcome obstacles and earn points. With its simple yet engaging gameplay, **DinoGame**  is sure to provide hours of fun for players of all ages.

# Rules of game

Jumping over obstacles earns the player one point, and if you earn enough points, map will be changed. But beware, as the speed of the obstacles increases with each new map, making the game progressively more challenging.

Press up to Jump.
